# Contributing to Awesome Open Source AI

Thank you for considering contributing to this curated list. We maintain **elite-tier quality standards** - this list is for battle-tested tools that have proven their value in production environments.

---

## Quality Bar: Battle-Tested & Production-Proven

This is not a directory of every open-source AI project. We curate tools that have survived real-world usage, earned community trust, and demonstrate sustained excellence.

### Elite Tier Criteria (Must Meet ALL)

Projects must satisfy **ALL of the following criteria** to be considered elite-tier. No exceptions except under maintainer discretion for truly exceptional cases.

| Criterion | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **⭐ GitHub Stars** | 1000+ | Indicates broad community adoption and trust |
| **🔄 Active Development** | Meaningful commits within last 6 months | Continuously evolving, not abandoned |
| **🏭 Production Usage** | Evidence of real-world deployment | Case studies, integrations, production issues/PRs |
| **📚 Quality Standards** | Proper docs, tests, releases | Not a thrown-together experiment |

### No Exceptions Except Maintainer Discretion

Meeting 3/4 is **not acceptable**. Projects must meet all criteria. The only path for projects falling short:

- **Maintainer Override** - Reserved for truly exceptional cases with extraordinary production traction or major organizational backing

---

## Curation Philosophy: "Current Best"

This list represents **"what you should know about now"** — not a historical archive.

### Replace, Don't Accumulate

When a newer version clearly supersedes an existing entry in the same category:

| Scenario | Action | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **New major version** | Update existing entry | PyTorch 2.4 → 2.5: Edit the line, don't add both |
| **Minor bump** | Skip unless significant | v1.2 → v1.3: Not worth a PR |
| **Both versions warranted** | Rare exception | Python 3.11/3.12 both deployed; SD 1.5 vs XL (different use cases) |

**The test:** Would a practitioner looking at this list today care about *both* versions, or just the current one?

For rapidly evolving families (foundation models, frameworks with numbered releases), always update the existing entry rather than appending. The list stays lean and relevant.

### Maintenance Cleanup Rule

- **Older than 6 months since latest push:** remove from the list completely
- **Active within 6 months but below 1000 stars:** move to [EMERGING.md](EMERGING.md)
- **Active within 6 months and 1000+ stars:** eligible to remain in the main README

This applies to existing entries as well as new submissions. The list is actively pruned, not just appended to.

---

## What We're Looking For

### ✅ Elite Indicators

- **Sustained adoption** - Growing star count over time, not a spike
- **Production testimonials** - Companies/teams using it in production
- **Ecosystem integration** - Referenced by other major projects
- **Responsive maintenance** - Active issue resolution, regular releases
- **Clear differentiation** - Solves a specific problem better than alternatives
- **Documentation quality** - Proper setup guides, API docs, examples

### 🚩 Disqualifying Red Flags

- Marketing-heavy descriptions without substance
- "Revolutionary" / "next-gen" / "game-changing" hype language
- Single-contributor repos with manufactured star counts
- Forks with minor feature additions claiming to be new projects
- No production users or real-world usage evidence
- Abandoned projects seeking attention
- AI-generated slop (low-effort boilerplate projects)

---

## Submission Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Verify your project meets ALL elite criteria** - if not, don't submit here (see the [Emerging & Innovations List →](EMERGING.md) for newer projects)
2. **Check for duplicates** - search the README and EMERGING lists first
3. **Ensure correct categorization** - place in the most specific section
4. **Write a factual description** - one sentence, no fluff

### PR Requirements

```markdown
- **[Project Name](https://github.com/owner/repo)** ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/owner/repo?style=social) - Factual one-sentence description.
```

**Good:**
> "High-performance vector search engine built in Rust with hybrid filtering and cloud-native architecture."

**Bad:**
> "The revolutionary next-generation AI-powered vector database disrupting the industry with bleeding-edge performance."

### Required PR Description

Your PR must include:

```markdown
## Project: [Name]

## Maintainer Discretion

The maintainer reserves final judgment on all submissions, including:

- **Rejecting** projects that technically meet criteria but lack production substance
- **Accepting** exceptional projects that may fall short on one criterion but demonstrate unique innovation with strong backing
- **Removing** existing entries if quality degrades or project becomes abandoned
- **Elevating** tools from emerging to elite tier as they mature

**Remember:** Meeting ALL criteria guarantees consideration, not acceptance. This list is about trust and proven value. Maintainer override is reserved for truly exceptional cases only.

---

## Emerging & Experimental Projects

Have a promising project that doesn't meet elite criteria yet?

We maintain the **[EMERGING.md](EMERGING.md)** list for:
- Active projects with **fewer than 1000 stars**
- Early-stage projects with strong potential
- Experimental research implementations
- Niche tools solving specific problems
- Newer repos that haven't been around long but show promise

### Emerging Tier Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **⭐ GitHub Stars** | Fewer than 1000 | Below elite threshold but showing traction |
| **🔄 Active Development** | Latest push within 6 months | Alive and evolving |
| **📝 Innovation** | Clear unique approach | Not a "me too" project |
| **📚 Quality** | Basic docs, working code | Professional intent |
| **🔮 Potential** | Maintainer discretion | Gut check on future elite |

### Emerging → Elite Promotion Path

Projects can graduate from Emerging to Elite when they meet **all** elite-tier criteria:

| Criterion | Emerging | Elite |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Stars | <1000 | 1000+ |
| Activity | 6 months | 6 months |
| Production | Early adopters | Real deployments |
| Quality | Basic | Full (docs/tests/releases) |

**Promotion process:**
1. Maintainer identifies project as ready (or author opens "Promotion Request" issue)
2. Project is added to Elite Tier in appropriate category
3. Project stays in Emerging for 30 days with a "🎓 Graduated" badge
4. Then removed from Emerging to keep the list fresh

### How to Submit to Emerging

Same process as Elite, but lower thresholds. In your PR, specify this is for Emerging:

```markdown
## Project: [Name]

### Emerging Criteria Checklist

- [ ] **Below 1000 stars** (otherwise submit to Elite)
- [ ] **Active** in last 6 months
- [ ] **Innovation** - what's unique about this approach
- [ ] **Quality** - basic docs and working code
- [ ] **License** - OSI-approved

### Target List
- [ ] Elite Tier (1000+ stars, active within 6 months, production usage)
- [x] Emerging List (active within 6 months, under 1000 stars, promising)

### Why This Belongs in Emerging
<!-- Explain the concept, innovation, and potential -->
```

### Emerging List Philosophy

- **Curated, not exhaustive** — still say no to low-effort projects
- **Fresh eyes welcome** — newer projects can get visibility
- **Quality over quantity** — 5 good entries > 50 mediocre ones
- **Promotion ready** — design entries to smoothly graduate to Elite

## Questions?

Open an issue for discussion before submitting borderline cases. We're happy to help evaluate whether your project fits the elite tier or should wait for the emerging list.
